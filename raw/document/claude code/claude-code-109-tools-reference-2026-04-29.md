Claude Code has access to a set of built-in tools that help it understand and modify your codebase. The tool names are the exact strings you use in [permission rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#tool-specific-permission-rules), [subagent tool lists](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents), and [hook matchers](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks). To disable a tool entirely, add its name to the `deny` array in your [permission settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#tool-specific-permission-rules). To add custom tools, connect an [MCP server](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp). To extend Claude with reusable prompt-based workflows, write a [skill](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills), which runs through the existing `Skill` tool rather than adding a new tool entry.  
| Tool  | Description  | Permission Required  |

| `Monitor`  | Runs a command in the background and feeds each output line back to Claude, so it can react to log entries, file changes, or polled status mid-conversation. See [Monitor tool](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#monitor-tool)  | Yes  |  
| `NotebookEdit`  | Modifies Jupyter notebook cells  | Yes  |

| `ReadMcpResourceTool`  | Reads a specific MCP resource by URI  | No  |  
| `SendMessage`  | Sends a message to an [agent team](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) teammate, or [resumes a subagent](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents#resume-subagents) by its agent ID. Stopped subagents auto-resume in the background. Only available when `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set  | No  |

| `TeamDelete`  | Disbands an agent team and cleans up teammate processes. Only available when `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` is set  | No  |  
| `TodoWrite`  | Manages the session task checklist. Available in non-interactive mode and the [Agent SDK](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/headless); interactive sessions use TaskCreate, TaskGet, TaskList, and TaskUpdate instead  | No  |  
| `ToolSearch`  | Searches for and loads deferred tools when [tool search](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp#scale-with-mcp-tool-search) is enabled  | No  |  
| `WebFetch`  | Fetches content from a specified URL  | Yes  |  
| `WebSearch`  | Performs web searches  | Yes  |  
| `Write`  | Creates or overwrites files  | Yes  |  
Permission rules can be configured using `/permissions` or in [permission settings](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#available-settings). Also see [Tool-specific permission rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#tool-specific-permission-rules).
## 
[​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#bash-tool-behavior)
Bash tool behavior
The Bash tool runs each command in a separate process with the following persistence behavior:
  * When Claude runs `cd` in the main session, the new working directory carries over to later Bash commands as long as it stays inside the project directory or an [additional working directory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#working-directories) you added with `--add-dir`, `/add-dir`, or `additionalDirectories` in settings. Subagent sessions never carry over working directory changes.
    * If `cd` lands outside those directories, Claude Code resets to the project directory and appends `Shell cwd was reset to <dir>` to the tool result.
    * To disable this carry-over so every Bash command starts in the project directory, set `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR=1`.
  * Environment variables do not persist. An `export` in one command will not be available in the next.

Activate your virtualenv or conda environment before launching Claude Code. To make environment variables persist across Bash commands, set [`CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/env-vars) to a shell script before launching Claude Code, or use a [SessionStart hook](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#persist-environment-variables) to populate it dynamically.
## 
[​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#lsp-tool-behavior)
LSP tool behavior
The LSP tool gives Claude code intelligence from a running language server. After each file edit, it automatically reports type errors and warnings so Claude can fix issues without a separate build step. Claude can also call it directly to navigate code:
  * Jump to a symbol’s definition
  * Find all references to a symbol
  * Get type information at a position
  * List symbols in a file or workspace
  * Find implementations of an interface
  * Trace call hierarchies

The tool is inactive until you install a [code intelligence plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/discover-plugins#code-intelligence) for your language. The plugin bundles the language server configuration, and you install the server binary separately.
## 
[​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#monitor-tool)
Monitor tool
The Monitor tool requires Claude Code v2.1.98 or later.
The Monitor tool lets Claude watch something in the background and react when it changes, without pausing the conversation. Ask Claude to:
  * Tail a log file and flag errors as they appear
  * Poll a PR or CI job and report when its status changes
  * Watch a directory for file changes
  * Track output from any long-running script you point it at

Claude writes a small script for the watch, runs it in the background, and receives each output line as it arrives. You keep working in the same session and Claude interjects when an event lands. Stop a monitor by asking Claude to cancel it or by ending the session. Monitor uses the same [permission rules as Bash](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions#tool-specific-permission-rules), so `allow` and `deny` patterns you have set for Bash apply here too. It is not available on Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry. It is also not available when `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` or `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` is set. Plugins can declare monitors that start automatically when the plugin is active, instead of asking Claude to start them. See [plugin monitors](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference#monitors).
## 
[​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#powershell-tool)
PowerShell tool
The PowerShell tool lets Claude run PowerShell commands natively. On Windows, this means commands run in PowerShell instead of routing through Git Bash. On Windows without Git Bash, the tool is enabled automatically. On Windows with Git Bash installed, the tool is rolling out progressively. On Linux, macOS, and WSL, the tool is opt-in.
### 
[​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#enable-the-powershell-tool)
Enable the PowerShell tool
Set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1` in your environment or in `settings.json`:

```
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL": "1"
  }
}

```

On Windows, set the variable to `0` to opt out of the rollout. On Linux, macOS, and WSL, the tool requires PowerShell 7 or later: install `pwsh` and ensure it is on your `PATH`. On Windows, Claude Code auto-detects `pwsh.exe` for PowerShell 7+ with a fallback to `powershell.exe` for PowerShell 5.1. The Bash tool remains registered alongside the PowerShell tool, so you may need to ask Claude to use PowerShell.
### 
[​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#shell-selection-in-settings-hooks-and-skills)
Shell selection in settings, hooks, and skills
Three additional settings control where PowerShell is used:
  * `"defaultShell": "powershell"` in [`settings.json`](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings#available-settings): routes interactive `!` commands through PowerShell. Requires the PowerShell tool to be enabled.
  * `"shell": "powershell"` on individual [command hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#command-hook-fields): runs that hook in PowerShell. Hooks spawn PowerShell directly, so this works regardless of `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL`.
  * `shell: powershell` in [skill frontmatter](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills#frontmatter-reference): runs `!`command`` blocks in PowerShell. Requires the PowerShell tool to be enabled.

The same main-session working-directory reset behavior described under the Bash tool section applies to PowerShell commands, including the `CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR` environment variable.
### 
[​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#preview-limitations)
Preview limitations
The PowerShell tool has the following known limitations during the preview:
  * PowerShell profiles are not loaded
  * On Windows, sandboxing is not supported


## 
[​](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#check-which-tools-are-available)
Check which tools are available
Your exact tool set depends on your provider, platform, and settings. To check what’s loaded in a running session, ask Claude directly:

```
What tools do you have access to?

```

Claude gives a conversational summary. For exact MCP tool names, run `/mcp`.
