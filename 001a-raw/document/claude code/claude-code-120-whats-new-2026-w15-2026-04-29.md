Releases [v2.1.92 → v2.1.101](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog#2-1-92)4 features · April 6–10
Ultraplanresearch preview
Kick off plan mode in the cloud from your terminal, then review the result in your browser. Claude drafts the plan in a Claude Code on the web session while your terminal stays free; when it’s ready you comment on individual sections, ask for revisions, and choose to execute remotely or send it back to your CLI. As of v2.1.101 the first run auto-creates a default cloud environment, so there’s no web setup step before you can try it.
Run the command, or just include the keyword in any prompt:
Claude Code

```
> /ultraplan migrate the auth service from sessions to JWTs

```

[Ultraplan guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/ultraplan)
Monitor toolv2.1.98
A new built-in tool that spawns a background watcher and streams its events into the conversation: each event lands as a new transcript message that Claude reacts to immediately. Tail a training run, babysit a PR’s CI, or auto-fix a dev server crash the moment it happens, all without a Bash sleep loop holding the turn open.
Ask Claude to watch something while you keep working:
Claude Code

```
> Tail server.log in the background and tell me the moment a 5xx shows up

```

This pairs with `/loop`, which now self-paces: omit the interval and Claude schedules the next tick based on the task, or reaches for the Monitor tool to skip polling altogether.
Claude Code

```
> /loop check CI on my PR

```

[Monitor tool reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/tools-reference#monitor-tool)
/autofix-prCLI
PR auto-fix landed on the web in Week 13. Now you can turn it on without leaving your terminal: `/autofix-pr` infers the open PR for your current branch and enables auto-fix for it on Claude Code on the web in one step. Push your branch, run the command, walk away; Claude watches CI and review comments and pushes fixes until it’s green.
Run it from the PR’s branch:
Claude Code

```
> /autofix-pr

```

[Auto-fix pull requests](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#auto-fix-pull-requests)
/team-onboardingv2.1.101
Generates a teammate ramp-up guide from your local Claude Code usage. Run it in a project you know well and hand the output to a new teammate so they can replay your setup instead of starting from defaults.
Run it from a project you’ve spent real time in:
Claude Code

```
> /team-onboarding

```

Other wins
Focus view: press `Ctrl+O` in flicker-free mode to collapse the view to your last prompt, a one-line tool summary with diffstats, and Claude’s final response
Guided [Bedrock](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/amazon-bedrock) and [Vertex AI](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/google-vertex-ai) setup wizards on the login screen: pick “3rd-party platform” for step-by-step auth, region, credential check, and model pinning
`/agents` gets a tabbed layout: a Running tab shows live subagents with a `● N running` count, plus Run agent and View running instance actions in the Library tab
Default effort level is now `high` for API-key, Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, Team, and Enterprise users (control with `/effort`)
`/cost` shows a per-model and cache-hit breakdown for subscription users
`/release-notes` is now an interactive version picker
Status line: new `refreshInterval` setting re-runs the command every N seconds, and `workspace.git_worktree` in the JSON input
`CLAUDE_CODE_PERFORCE_MODE`: Edit/Write fail on read-only files with a `p4 edit` hint instead of silently overwriting
OS CA certificate store is now trusted by default, so enterprise TLS proxies work without extra setup (`CLAUDE_CODE_CERT_STORE=bundled` to opt out)
Amazon Bedrock powered by Mantle: set `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_MANTLE=1`
Hardened Bash tool permissions: backslash-escaped flags, env-var prefixes, `/dev/tcp` redirects, and compound commands now prompt correctly
`UserPromptSubmit` hooks can set the session title via `hookSpecificOutput.sessionTitle`
